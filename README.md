# Crop-Prediction
# Problem Statement:
Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, and accurately predicting crop production is essential for improving planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop a regression model that forecasts crop production (in tons) based on agricultural factors such as area harvested (in hectares), yield (in kg/ha), and the year, for various crops grown in a specific region.
# Business Use Cases:
- Food Security and Planning: Provide insights to governments and NGOs to plan food supply and reduce the risk of food shortages by predicting crop yields accurately.
- Agricultural Policy Development: Assist policymakers in framing agricultural subsidies, crop insurance, and disaster relief programs by understanding potential production trends.
- Supply Chain Optimization: Help agribusinesses and distributors plan storage, transportation, and market supply chains based on expected production volumes.
- Market Price Forecasting: Enable farmers and traders to predict market trends and make informed decisions about selling crops at optimal times.
- Precision Farming: Guide farmers in selecting the most suitable crops for their land and environmental conditions, optimizing resource usage like water and fertilizers.
-  Agro-Technology Solutions: Provide valuable data for agri-tech startups to design tools and applications that help farmers monitor and enhance crop production.

# Approach:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing data and standardize column metrics.
- Filter relevant columns for analysis data. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze Crop Distribution
- Crop Types: Study the distribution of the Item column to identify the most and least cultivated crops across regions.
- Geographical Distribution: Explore the Area column to understand which regions focus on specific crops or have high agricultural activity.
# Temporal Analysis
- Yearly Trends: Analyze the Year column to detect trends in Area harvested, Yield, and Production over time.
- Growth Analysis: Investigate if certain crops or regions show increasing or decreasing trends in yield or production.
# Environmental Relationships
- Although explicit environmental data is absent, infer relationships between the Area harvested and Yield to check if thereâ€™s an impact of resource utilization on crop productivity.
# Input-Output Relationships
- Study correlations between Area harvested, Yield, and Production to understand the relationship between land usage and productivity.
# Comparative Analysis
- Across Crops: Compare yields (Yield) of different crops (Item) to identify high-yield vs. low-yield crops.
- Across Regions: Compare production (Production) across different areas (Area) to find highly productive regions.
# Productivity Analysis
- Examine variations in Yield to identify efficient crops and regions.
- Calculate productivity ratios: Production/Area harvested to cross-verify yields.
# Outliers and Anomalies
- Identify anomalies in Yield or Production, such as unusually high or low values, and correlate them with potential external factors like policies or environmental changes.
# 3. Task: 
- Predicting Production (Production, measured in tons):
- Use Case: Focuses on total output. It answers, "What will the total production of a specific crop be for a given region and year?"
